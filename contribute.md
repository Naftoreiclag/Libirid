Contributing
=======================
Since we plan to have literally *everything* in this game, it's infeasable to *not* have help in making it. This project is open for anyone to contribute to.

How to Contribute
-----------------------
Same as always:

1.  Fork this project's repository.

2.  Make some changes / additions as you see fit.

3.  Make a pull request back into the main project.

4.  If we like it, then we'll accept it! (See terms and conditions)

Terms and Conditions
-----------------------
This is pretty obvious, but we cannot and shouldnot have anything offensive in this game. [GitHub's terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service) eloquently describes such unacceptable content:
>We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and Accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Service.

Also, try to make any code you submit as bug-free as possible. Also pretty obvious.

Questions (and Answers?)
-----------------------
**Is my idea dumb?**  
No more than the idea of this whole project.

**Can I add X?**  
As long as it does not conflict with the Terms and Conditions.

**Can I license my code under something other than MIT?**  
1.  It cannot be a [copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/index.html) license. It would force the other licenses to become copyleft.  
2.  It cannot restrict redistribution of the source code.  
3.  It must be licensed under something.
