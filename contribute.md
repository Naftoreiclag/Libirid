Contributing
=======================
Since we plan to have literally *everything* in this game, it's infeasable to *not* have help in making it. This project is open for anyone to contribute to.

How to Contribute
-----------------------
Same as always:

1.  Fork this project's repository.

2.  Make some changes / additions as you see fit.

3.  Make a pull request back into the main project.

4.  If we like it, then we'll accept it! (See terms and conditions)

Terms and Conditions
-----------------------
This is pretty obvious, but we cannot and shouldnot have anything offensive in this game. [GitHub's terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service) eloquently describes such unacceptable content:
>We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and Accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Service.

Also, try to make any code you submit as bug-free as possible. Also pretty obvious.

Questions (and Answers?)
-----------------------
**Is my idea for a contribution dumb?**  
No more than the idea of this whole project.

**Can I add X?**  
As long as it does not conflict with the Terms and Conditions.

**Can I license my code under something other than MIT?**  
1.  It cannot be a [copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/index.html) license. It would force the other licenses to become copyleft.  
2.  It cannot restrict redistribution of the source code.  
3.  It must be licensed under something. (i.e. the source code must explicitly specify what license it is under. Even if it is in public domain, the source code must read "public domain" somewhere in it.)

Some examples of acceptable licenses:
* [Apache License 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
* BSD [3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) or [2-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
* [Public Domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)
* [zlib/libpng License (Zlib)](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)
* [Boost License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSL-1.0)*

Right now, we are comfortably sitting on the statement "Our entire repository is under the MIT License." You don't wanna be the first to turn our statement into "Most of our repository," do you?

**Are you insane?**  
Not clinically.

**Can I use some of this repository's code for my own project?**  
Yes! Just make sure you comply with the licenses, which don't ask for much other than including a few lines of comments at the top of each file. Some credit for the original author(s) would be nice, though.

**What does the word "Libirid" mean?**  
That does not relate to contributions, but I'm sure you are curious. It is a combination of the Latin roots *libr*, meaning "book," and *irid*, meaning "rainbow." Libirid's name literally means "Book-Rainbow." The book part is obvious; reading is essential to gameplay. The rainbow part refers to the wide variety of things you can do in the book - as vast or vast-er as the rainbow!
