Lore
=======================
Whenever I play a new video game, I always test the limits to what can and cannot be done by the player. I usually start with *"shoot a friendly NPC"* and *"stack up explosives to climb over wall"*. Usually stuff like that is allowed, but the freedom stops if I go into *"lick cave wall"* and *"shave head and use hair to start fire"*. Most of the time, the game plays smoothly without me ever noticing that I *couldn't* have solved that puzzle with a rocket-launcher instead of a key, but I can never shake the feeling that the game is nothing but a movie that involves button presses to advance it.

In this game, I hope to eventually give the player the freedom to do *everything* imaginable. Don't feel like giving that goblin the 5 gold coins to cross the bridge? Just slice his head off! Don't feel like searching for a key to the dungeon? Blow the door clean off with your C-4! Don't feel like not eating rocks for health? Then eat all the stone you want! (Just make sure you are willing to take the "broken teeth" debuff...)

It's a text-adventure game, so it utilizes the second-most powerful graphics-rendering engine known to humanity: your imagination!

Some Plans
=======================
* Make some plans.
* Do something with Lua scripting.
