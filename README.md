Fuzzy Computing Machine
=======================

Exactly what the repository is called. This is (not really) a fuzzy computing machine!

Actually, this is some kinda simulator that I'm making. 
That "fuzzy-computing-machine" name is thanks to GitHub's random* name generator. 
I plan on coming up with a better name... someday.

Some stuff about this project:
* Uses only standard (std::) C++ libraries
* All the source code here was made by me! (As of writing.)
* Uses [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) as main IDE.

Happy 100th Commit!
